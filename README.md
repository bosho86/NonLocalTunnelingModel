# NonLocalTunnelingModel
This is the Non-Local-Tunneling Model used for simulating source to drain tunneling in ultra short transistors.
The mat files are postprocessing files from Sentaurus S-Device from a double gate InGaAs ultra thin film FET, Lg=11.5 nm.
This postprocessing files include the conduction band, the fermi energies and the current.
